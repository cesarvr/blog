My name is César Valdez, I’m a software engineer currently working at Red Hat, I love computer since I got in my hands my first computer a Compaq 425, my first programming language was Visual Basic 5.0 which I teach myself by reading the MVB help files, that said a lot about the quality of that documentation. 

After that I learn QBasic and C. Seems like yesterday when I was showing my friends my first hello world in C and feeling like a hacker. Then I discover that there was a group of rebels that wrote their own operative system and tools. And that's how I became an open source enthusiast.

I like to learn about operative systems, algorithms and design in general. The things I most love about my job is to tackle complex problems in elegant and creative ways, like when I create a bridge between Java and JS (Node.js) so I can consume the best libraries available in Java and still have the simplicity and higher level of abstraction of JS. I was able to use [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/core/) in a Node.js server-side application. That's the type of crazy stuff I love to do :).     
Aside from computer I also love reading about philosophy like Sartre, Descartes, Cornel West, etc. I get introduce to those ideas thanks to one of my favourite film the documentary The Matrix. Now I struggling reading [Simulacra and Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation) thanks to the Wachowski brothers. 


## Projects 

Here are some of my open source projects:

- [PDF-Generator](https://github.com/cesarvr/pdf-generator)
    A Apache Cordova plugin to create PDF using phone internal API develop compatible with iOS/Android.

- [Ella](https://github.com/cesarvr/Ella)
    Is a native Node.JS plugin that let you write Java inside Javascript, I wrote it in C++ and JNI.

- [probe-mon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/probe-mon)
    An ugly named, but easy to use plugin is a ExpressJS middleware that helps time your endpoints.


## Graphics 

I'm also love graphics programming and every now and then I like to teach my self some of the math behind computer graphics. Here are some of my hobby projects: 

#### WebGL 

This is some of my pet projects with WebGL, experimenting with fractals, geometry deformation and other stuff.

[fractal-2d](https://github.com/cesarvr/fractal-gl)

[fractal-3d](http://cesarvr.github.io/fractal3d/app.html)

#### C/C++ 
Some 3d stuff using C++

Here I was learning the basics, OpenGL initialization, pushing triangles and writing simple shaders.

As I become more skilled I wrote this simple graphic engine with simple wavefront parser, skybox, camera manipulation and simple light simulation.
