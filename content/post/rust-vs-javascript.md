A while ago I wrote a [blog post](https://cesarvr.io/post/rust-performance/) post about my learning adventure with Rust, to make thing interesting I was trying to use Rust to solve some [programming puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/5) and by curiosity I decided to use this puzzle as a benchmark to measure what language was faster Rust or Javascript.

On paper the Rust implementation should win by a mile, surprisingly I found out that I was wrong so I started to profile the code looking for bottlenecks and found something interesting, I was using the [slowest function to turn characters to lowercase](https://cesarvr.io/post/rust-performance/), fixing this issue put things on par.

But that was on Linux, when I moved the code to MacOS I found out that the JS implementation was still performing faster there.


```sh
Node   0.17s user 0.03s system 101% cpu 0.209 total
Rust   0.23s user 0.01s system 98% cpu 0.238 total
```

Well time to do more profiling this time using [Instruments](https://help.apple.com/instruments/mac/current/) on MacOS, then looking at the samples I found the issue:  

![](https://github.com/cesarvr/hugo-blog/blob/master/static/rust/malloc-xcode-2.png?raw=true)

It seems that the Rust version is spending the majority of its time doing memory allocation triggered by a ``string:Clone`` method, this is what the Rust docs has to say about it:

> [[Clone]](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html) differs from Copy in that Copy is implicit and extremely inexpensive, while Clone is always explicit and may or may not be expensive...

Well it seems that I got the expensive part here, so I decided to [look for parts of my code](https://github.com/cesarvr/AOCRust/blob/master/day-5/first/src/main.rs) that might trigger a ``string::clone``, and one of those candidates was ``to_vec`` which the documentation defines as:

> Copies self into a new Vec.

Very economic definition, but this is what happens behind the scene, when you call ``to_vec`` you basically first allocating memory in the heap 

you get the idea, the only problem is that the code was very dependent on ``to_vec`` and I didnâ€™t feel in the mood of starting a discussion with the [borrow checker](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.8.0/book/references-and-borrowing.html) over how to move things around, so I decided to rewrite the code from scratch.  


```rust
use std::fs;
use std::cmp;
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn solve1(input: &str) -> usize {
    let mut reacts = Vec::new();

    for n in input.chars() {

        if reacts.is_empty() {
            reacts.push(n);
            continue;
        }

        if let Some(bn) = reacts.pop() {
            if bn.eq_ignore_ascii_case(&n) && bn != n {
                continue;
            }else{
                reacts.push(bn);
                reacts.push(n);
            }
        }
    }

    reacts.len() - 1
}

fn solve2(input: &str) -> u32 {
    let mut repeated = HashMap::new();
    let mut minimal: u32 = std::u32::MAX;

    for c in input.chars() {
        if None != repeated.get(&c.to_ascii_lowercase()){
            continue;
        }

        let batch = input.chars().filter(|n| {
            !c.eq_ignore_ascii_case(&n)
        });

        let solved = solve1(&batch.collect::<String>());
        minimal = cmp::min(minimal, solved as u32);

        repeated.insert(c.to_ascii_lowercase(), true);
    }

    minimal
}

fn main() {
    let input = fs::read_to_string("input.txt").expect("Unable to read file");

    println!("solution 1: {}", solve1(&input));
    println!("solution 2: {}", solve2(&input));
}
```

The main focus [this time](https://github.com/cesarvr/AOCRust/blob/master/day-5/rewrite/src/main.rs) was to pass the string by reference instead of passing vector copies (looking back now seems like obvious), use the ``string::iterator`` to scan the characters and as a small bonus I simplify the matching and reducing of letters, when I ran this new version and got this:


```sh
Node   0.17s user 0.03s system 101% cpu 0.209 total
Rust   0.02s user 0.00s system  82% cpu 0.025 total
```
> 8x faster, not bad :)

All this happens because of some preconceived ideas I had about Rust, that high level syntax had tricked me to believe that it was a high level language when in reality behind all that syntax sugar it requires you to be aware of not only the low-level details but also how the language implements certain things in order to write efficient software. It was that or just JS had made me softer.

In other words, getting performance out of Rust is not free and I suspect that this learning curve will be the main challenge to become widely adopted. But definitely good choice if you want to write difficult to exploit code with close to C/C++ performance.

Talking about that I wrote a C/C++ version of this puzzle (a very naive version not an expert in C++) and this is what I got:

```sh
C++ 0.10s user 0.00s system 87% cpu 0.122 total
```

I will do some experimentations now and see if I can get it faster and maybe try to write a blog entry about it.
