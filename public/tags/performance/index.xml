      <description>I had the impression that Rust being a system language its performance should be comparable only to C/C++ and that the worst code in Rust should be faster than good code written in a high level language such as JavaScript. I discover that that&#39;s surprisingly not always the true.
This happened while I was trying to learn Rust programming language by solving the day-5 puzzle on this website called Advent Of Code 2018.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my hobbies is to write (and sometimes re-write) graphic libraries in various languages. I like to do this because, for one thing I like to see cool animation flying on the screen and nice side effect is that when your code is not performant the animation on the screen will let you know, as simple as that if you write good enough code you will receive a quick feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
