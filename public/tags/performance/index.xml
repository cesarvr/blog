      <description>After spending some weeks playing with Rust, I felt ready to test my skills and try some programming challenges in the Advent Of Code. My approach to tackle some of those challenges was to solve them on Javascript first (I use it in my day to day) to then port the code to Rust, while porting I just focus on getting the Rust code as elegant as possible. It was after finishing porting this puzzle in particular and feeling a sense of accomplishment that I decided to test how the Rust compiled code will perform against Javascript interpreter.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my hobbies is to write (and sometimes re-write) graphic libraries in various languages. I like to do this because, for one thing I like to see cool animation flying on the screen and nice side effect is that when your code is not performant the animation on the screen will let you know, as simple as that if you write good enough code you will receive a quick feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
