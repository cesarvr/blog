    <h2 class="post-title">Rust Performance</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">After having spent some weeks playing with Rust I felt I was ready to put my knowledge to test and solve some of the challenges on the Advent Of Code which is a nice site with programming puzzles. Some of the challenges are complex for one to try to solve them on a new language, so sometimes I solve them in Javascript first and the port it to Rust.
Once I finish one of the puzzles and knowing that one of the Rust strongest points aside from security was its C&#43;&#43; like performance....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">To take full advantage of Openshift we should change the way we build, deploy and run software. To spark that change here some good engineering principles (that later will become buzzwords on their own) extracted from an interview with Werner Vogel Amazon&#39;s CTO on 2006.
Encapsulation  We went through a period of serious introspection and concluded that a service-oriented architecture would give us the level of isolation that would allow us to build many software components rapidly and independently…...</p>

    <h2 class="post-title">Performance Profiling in Rust</h2>
  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">I had the impression that Rust being a system language its performance should be comparable only to C/C&#43;&#43; and that the worst code in Rust should be faster than good code written in a high level language such as JavaScript. I discover that that&#39;s surprisingly not always the true.
This happened while I was trying to learn Rust programming language by solving the day-5 puzzle on this website called Advent Of Code 2018....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Few days ago I was watching in Youtube a talk given by Kelsey Hightower titled “Self Deploying Kubernetes Applications”. In this talk which is a bit old now (over a year) he was demoing a Golang application capable of running locally but also capable of magically deploy itself into a Kubernetes cluster.

  <p class="post-summary">In the previous post we where able to collect information about pods running in our cluster thanks to the deployment of our Ambassador container, but having this information is of little value if we don&#39;t have a way to make sense of it. In this post we are going to develop a new functionality in our Ambassador so we can publish this information into a service.

  <p class="post-summary">Let say we have a micro-service exposing some business API and we want to gather some data about its usage, such as how many calls, payload size, errors, response time, etc. Adding this feature would usually involve writing some code, testing and the re-deployment of a new version. But when you have multiple micro-services, this solution can be difficult to reuse.

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">One of my hobbies is to write (and sometimes re-write) graphic libraries in various languages. I like to do this because, for one thing I like to see cool animation flying on the screen and nice side effect is that when your code is not performant the animation on the screen will let you know, as simple as that if you write good enough code you will receive a quick feedback.
